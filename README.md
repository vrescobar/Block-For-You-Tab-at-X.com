# X.com For You Blocker extension

**ForYouBlocker** is a lightweight and easy-to-read Google Chrome and Safari
extension that hides the distracting "For You" tab on Twitter (now X.com) and
automatically selects the "Following" tab by default.

This tool was created for users who prefer a happy X.com experience, and without
a complicated web extension with many options or weird unknown changes.

It just does one simple thing well, and the code is so straightworward to read
so even novel programers are sure there is no malware or whatsoever.

> **Note:**\
> You need to install it all by yourself, I did not pack it and upload either to
> the App Store or to Chrome's Web Store.
>
> Both stores have a developer registration fee, which I do not need for any
> other project (which are about $5 and $100 respectively) but you can compile
> and install the extension by yourself.

Inspired by some friends, I decided to accept donations for this purpose:

- If I reach 10€ I will upload and make publicly available the Chrome Extension
- If I reach 125€ I will upload and make public and free the extension the
  safari extension also on Apple Store

If you decide to sponsor the project, I accept a donation via

Since the extension is not distributed via the Chrome Web Store, you have two
options for installation:

![Screenshot2 of the extensions page with the extension loaded](imgs/Screenshot2.png)

#### Method 1: Installing the Packaged (.crx) Extension

1. **Download the [ForYouBlocker.crx](ForYouBlocker.crx) file.**

2. **Open Chrome or Brave** and navigate to: `chrome://extensions` or
   `brave://extensions`

3. **Enable Developer Mode**\
   Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner of the Extensions
   page.

4. **Drag and Drop**\
   Drag the `ForYouBlocker.crx` file into the Extensions page.\
   When prompted, click **Add extension** to confirm the installation.

> **Note:**\
> If dragging the file doesn’t work (or if Chrome/Brave blocks the
> installation), try Method 2.

#### Method 2: Loading the Unpacked Extension

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**\
   Make sure you have the full project folder (including the `ForYouBlocker`
   folder with `manifest.json` and `content.js`).

2. **Open Chrome or Brave** and go to: `chrome://extensions` or
   `brave://extensions`

3. **Enable Developer Mode**\

## Installation Instructions for Safari (Mac and iOS)

It requires Mac developer tools and to enable iphone developer mode. So git
clone this repository and install Apple's developer tools (xcode) and get a
cable to plug your phone to the computer.

#### Compile it (not optional)

`xcrun safari-web-extension-converter --project-location ForYouBlocker-ios $(pwd)/ForYouBlocker`

Xcode will be open, click on: Product > Build

#### Install on Safari (Mac)

1. Follow the official instructions (safari settings, developer, allow
   unassigned extensions and then enable it). But better read
   [The official documentation from apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/running-your-safari-web-extension)
   since soon the extensions will have the same rules as an app.
2. Open x.com or reload the wbpage
3. If you followed the path of a "unsigned extensions" a white square with an
   exclamation mark next to the address bar will appear, clock on it and select
   "always allow on this website".
4. Your extension should be active

#### Install on iPhone or iPad

Follow the
[official instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/running-your-safari-web-extension)
which is mostly:

1. Complete the Mac installation first
2. Enable developer mode on your iphone and restart it
3. Plug the iphone to your mac
4. Run and install the application from xcode.
5. If only compiles for mac's safari, remember to configure the project and
   under targets, add the destination "iPhone"

### If I install it as a PWA....

If you add the safari page as a PWA, unfortunately at this point in time, safari
does not allow to run browser extensions in them.
